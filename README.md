# 🧹 Data Cleaning Projects with Python & Pandas

Welcome to my daily **Data Cleaning Projects** repository! This space is dedicated to practicing and improving data cleaning skills using **Python** and **pandas**.

## 📋 What to Expect

- 📊 **Small Datasets**: Each project uses small, manageable datasets focused on **real-world formatting and data quality issues**.  
- 🧠 **All Types of Mess**: Expect missing values, inconsistent formats, incorrect data types, duplicates, typos, special characters, malformed emails, and more.
- 🔁 **Daily Practice**: Projects are added regularly, each one slightly more challenging than the last.
- 🧪 **Progressive Complexity**:  
   Starting from basic cleaning tasks and gradually moving towards:
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Feature Engineering
   - A/B Testing simulation
   - Final conclusions and recommendations

## 🛠 Tools Used

- `Python 3.x`  
- `pandas`  
- Occasionally:
  - `re` (regex)
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  -  `plotly.express`

## 📁 Project Structure

📂 project-name/
┣ 📄 raw_data.csv
┣ 📄 cleaned_data.csv
┣ 📄 cleaning_script.ipynb
┗ 📄 README.md

Each folder contains:
- A raw dataset
- A cleaned version (when applicable)
- A Jupyter Notebook with detailed, step-by-step cleaning

## 🎯 Goal

To build a strong and practical foundation in cleaning and preparing real-world data, ultimately evolving toward full analytical pipelines ready for storytelling, dashboards, and decision-making.
